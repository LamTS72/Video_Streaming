# Video_Streaming
Objectives:
*We will implement a streaming video server and client that communicate using the Real-Time Streaming
*Protocol (RTSP) and send data using the Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP).
Requirement:
We will provide you code that implements the RTSP protocol in the server, the RTP de-packetization in the client, and takes care of simply displaying the
transmitted video.
